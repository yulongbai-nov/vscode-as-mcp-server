# 2025-10-15 Session Log

## 12:35 UTC
- Reviewed GitHub Actions failures: text editor tool `skip_dialog` path still opened diff view, causing headless timeouts; execute command suite hit 10s timeout on `sleep` scenario.
- Confirmed local workspace already had contributor docs (`AGENTS.md`, `INDEX.md`) and prior contexts.

## 12:42 UTC
- Patched `EditorManager.insertText` to short-circuit straight to `workspace.fs.writeFile` when `skip_dialog` is true, bypassing diff UI setup.
- Re-ran `pnpm --filter "./packages/extension" test`; suite now fully passes (35 passing / 0 failing).

## 12:48 UTC
- Updated `contexts.md` with new findings and evidence timestamp.
- Prepared to push fix and monitor remote CI once committed.
