# Session Context

- Date: 2025-10-15
- Branch: main (clean after commit `fix(tests): re-enable command and transport suites`)
- Focus: Flaky VS Code extension tests stabilized; execute command, text editor, and BiDi transport suites now run end-to-end.
- Environment: Debian container; VS Code test harness 1.105.0 cached in `packages/extension/.vscode-test`.
- Findings:
  - `ExecuteCommandTool` normalizes/validates working dirs before launching terminals (`packages/extension/src/tools/execute_command.ts:39`).
  - Absolute fixture paths keep terminal/file operations deterministic in tests (`packages/extension/src/test/tools/execute_command.test.ts:65`).
  - Text editor tool `skip_dialog` path now applies edits directly without opening diff UIs, keeping create/replace/insert tests stable (`packages/extension/src/tools/text_editor.ts:234`).
  - BiDi transport awaits Express shutdown and restarts cleanly during handover (`packages/extension/src/bidi-http-transport.ts:15`).
- 2025-10-15 12:47 UTC follow-up:
  - Ensured `insert` operations honour `skip_dialog` by writing via `workspace.fs` before diff setup (`packages/extension/src/tools/text_editor.ts:330`).
  - Local VS Code integration tests green after fix (`pnpm --filter "./packages/extension" test` → 35 passing, 0 failing).
- Evidence: `pnpm --filter "./packages/extension" test` → 35 passing, 0 failing (12:47 UTC).
- Next Opportunities:
  1. Review whether `restartDelayMs` should be configurable for production deployments.
  2. Assess terminal shell integration warnings (`no_shell_integration`) for non-integrated shells.
